# proyectoNavie

this project focuses on image classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset. This dataset contains images categorized into six different classes representing diverse landscapes, including buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets.

In this project, I implemented a deep learning-based classification model leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately categorize images.
